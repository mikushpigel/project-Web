                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        No!
                        Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone.

                        Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an
                        "official"
                        Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their
                        products
                        or
                        services to those who do not know better.
                        Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                        parade
                        krewe
                        is
                        responsible for all of its merchandise.

                        In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration,
                        but
                        this
                        is
                        not true in New Orleans..

                        Red Cross volunteers, in partnership with New Orleans first responders, will be
                        providing
                        basic
                        first aid in some of the most populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained
                        in
                        CPR
                        and
                        first aid and will assist the ill and injured at each of their stations positioned along
                        the
                        parade
                        routes.

                        First aid stations will be available on the following corners along St. Charles Avenue
                        during
                        many
                        of our larger parades the last two weeks of Mardi Gras season:

                        Canal Street | Napoleon Avenue | Washington Avenue | Felicity Street | Lee Circle
                        Additionally, first aid stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy
                        Street,
                        as
                        well as North Carrolton Avenue and Bienville Street on the Saturday before Mardi Gras
                        for
                        the
                        Endymion parade.

                        The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar
                        or
                        rental
                        car
                        depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots
                        will be
                        difficult.

                    <p>
                        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those
                        of
                        us
                        who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going
                        to
                        every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags
                        (even
                        large
                        garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed
                        animals,
                        beads, and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades
                        pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon
                        since
                        parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St.
                        Charles
                        is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position,
                        having
                        picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry
                        about
                        the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                        Metairie,
                        which
                        is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before
                        Mardi
                        Gras
                        weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                        The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted
                        to
                        be
                        severe. The local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour
                        updates.

                        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This
                        is
                        the
                        weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
                        streets of
                        New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you
                        can
                        stay
                        longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience
                        Mardi
                        Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                        festival
                        goes
                        on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes
                        and
                        masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                        a

                        The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it
                        will
                        change
                        from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
                        since
                        a
                        chilly
                        morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can
                        get
                        somewhat
                        dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll
                        definitely
                        want
                        to bring a raincoat!
